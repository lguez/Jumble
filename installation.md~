# Installation

## Dependencies

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) (version â‰¥ 3.16)[^1].

- A Fortran compiler.

## Instructions

1. Download
   [Jumble](https://github.com/lguez/Jumble/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

2. Unzip it:

		unzip Jumble-master.zip

3. Decide in which directory you want to install Jumble after
   compilation and type the command below with your choice after
   `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=` (enter an absolute path). For example:

        cmake -B build -S Jumble-master -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local

   The command above is the configuration command. It will create a
   directory named build.
4. Compile:

		cmake --build build

5. Install:

        cmake --install build

You do not need to keep the downloaded directory Jumble-master nor the
build directory after installation.

## Advanced instructions

- You can choose any name and any location for the build
  directory. You have to refer to the source directory when you run
  the configuration command:

		cmake -B /wherever/any/name -S /where/I/downloaded/Jumble-master -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local

- Optionally, in the configuration command, you can change the
  precision for real numbers of procedures `zroots_unity`, `outersum`,
  `cumprod`, `outerdiv` and `vabs`. By default, the precision for real
  numbers in Jumble is set to be the default kind of the real type of
  the Fortran compiler you will use. You can change the value for the
  procedures listed above to any real kind you want. For example:

		cmake .. -DJumble_CPP_WP='kind(0d0)'

	or you could choose `selected_real_kind(10)` for example, etc.

    site, run it, then click on "How to Install For Command Line Use"
    in the Tools menu.
